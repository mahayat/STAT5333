## Problem 4.3
(a) Here, ML fit of linear probability model is $\hat{\pi} = 0.7578-0.0694x$ which means that after each decade "the percentage of times the starting pitcher pitched a complete game" decreases by a factor of 0.0694.

(b) 
```{r}
(0.7578-0.0694*12)
```
Persentage cannot be negative, hence it is not plausible.

(c) Here, ML fit of logistic regression model is $$\hat{\pi} =\frac{e^{1.148-0.315x}}{1+e^{1.148-0.315x}}$$
```{r}
x = 12
exp(1.148-0.315*x)/(1+exp(1.148-0.315*x))
```
This is plausible because $\hat{\pi}$ is always between $[0, 1]$.
